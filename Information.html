    <h1>HIV and AIDS</h1>
    <p>
        HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system fight off infections. If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).
    </p>

    <h2>Causes of HIV:</h2>
    <p>
        HIV is primarily transmitted through the following ways:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Unprotected Sexual Contact:</h3>
    <p>
        The most common mode of transmission is through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person. This includes vaginal, anal, and oral sex.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Contaminated Blood:</h3>
    <p>
        HIV can be transmitted through the exchange of blood. This can happen through sharing needles or syringes with someone who is infected, receiving contaminated blood products, or organ transplantation from an infected donor.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Mother-to-Child Transmission:</h3>
    <p>
        HIV can be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during childbirth or breastfeeding.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Occupational Exposure:</h3>
    <p>
        Healthcare workers may be at risk of HIV transmission through accidental needle sticks or contact with infected blood.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevention of HIV:</h2>

    <h3>Safe Sex Practices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Always use condoms or dental dams during sexual intercourse, especially with new or unknown partners.</li>
        <li>Limit the number of sexual partners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Get Tested and Know Your Partner's Status:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly get tested for HIV and encourage your partner to do the same.</li>
        <li>Knowing your status and the status of your partner can help make informed decisions about prevention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use Clean Needles:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you inject drugs, use clean needles and do not share them with others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PrEP is a medication taken by individuals who are at high risk of contracting HIV to prevent infection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment as Prevention (TasP):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Individuals with HIV can take antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce their viral load, making them less likely to transmit the virus to others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mother-to-Child Prevention:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pregnant women with HIV can reduce the risk of transmission to their child through medications and proper medical care.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Abstaining from HIV:</h2>
    <p>
        While abstinence from sexual activities and intravenous drug use is the surest way to prevent HIV, it may not be practical for everyone. Therefore, practicing safe sex, getting tested regularly, and taking preventive measures, such as PrEP, can significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Education and awareness about HIV and AIDS are crucial in promoting safe behaviors and reducing stigma associated with the infection. If you have concerns or questions about HIV, it's important to consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice and information.
